        "1. Vectorization:\n",
        "Definition: Vectorization refers to the process of applying operations to entire arrays (or vectors) in a single step, without using explicit loops. In NumPy, this is achieved by applying element-wise operations directly on arrays, which are optimized using low-level implementations in C.\n",

        "Definition: Broadcasting is a mechanism that allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes by \"stretching\" the smaller array along an axis to match the shape of the larger array. Instead of manually reshaping or duplicating arrays, broadcasting allows NumPy to implicitly expand dimensions for element-wise operations.\n",
